Description: XssPy is a python tool for finding Cross Site Scripting 
vulnerabilities in websites. This tool is the first of its kind.
Instead of just checking one page as most of the tools do, this tool 
traverses the website and find all the links and subdomains first.
After that, it starts scanning each and every input on each and every
 page that it found while its traversal. It uses small yet effective
payloads to search for XSS vulnerabilities. 

With this tool, Cross Site Scripting vulnerabilities have been found in the websites of MIT, Stanford, Duke University, Informatica, Formassembly, ActiveCompaign, Volcanicpixels, Oxford, Motorola, Berkeley and many more.
